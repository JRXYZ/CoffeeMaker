# CoffeeMaker
This is part of a project to manage a coffee maker at home from a Android mobile phone. It's made up of an Android app written in Kotlin as the front-end, Firebase service as the back-end and Raspberry PI 3 as a single board computer with a script written in Javascript running on Node.JS and integrated to a coffee maker with water level sensors.
